# Forage-Internship-Commonweal-Bank---Intro-to-Software-Engineering

Welcome to Commonwealth Bank’s Software Engineering Program! This program is designed to show you what it’s like to be a software engineer working at Commonwealth Bank. You’ll be stepping into the role of an entry-level software engineer tasked with building a website containing information about financial cybersecurity. 

For this first Task, your manager has asked you to build a simple web page using HTML and CSS. They would like for the page’s title to be “Tips for Financial Cybersecurity” and for the body to contain some placeholder text. They’ve also suggested that you experiment with adding a background colour or changing font features like colour, size, and style.

At the end of this Task, you’ll have a simple web page that you can view in your very own browser. You’ll be building on this page throughout the rest of this program. For more information about HTML, CSS and the basics of building a web page
